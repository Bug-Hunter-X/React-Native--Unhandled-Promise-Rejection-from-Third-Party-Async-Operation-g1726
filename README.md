This repository demonstrates a common, yet often overlooked, bug in React Native development: unhandled promise rejections originating from asynchronous operations within third-party libraries. The issue arises when the library's asynchronous actions don't gracefully handle potential delays or network issues, leading to inconsistencies in UI updates and potential app crashes. The provided solution showcases how to implement proper error handling and fallback mechanisms to mitigate these risks and ensure a more robust application.
